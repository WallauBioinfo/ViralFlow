# ViralFlow

This repository contains the code of ViralFlow, a workflow that performs a reference-guided genome assembly of non-segmented viruses written in Nextflow. The workflow was developed to work with Illumina paired-end reads. Tests with other technologies should be performed.

## Documentation

The official documentation can be accessed [here](https://viralflow.github.io/index-en.html) in English or [here](https://viralflow.github.io/) in Portuguese.

ViralFlow is a Nextflow pipeline and should be treated as such; check `vfnext/` for more details.  
A wrapper for the pipeline is provided for user convenience.
